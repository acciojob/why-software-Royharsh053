	<h1>Why I want to become a developer ?</h1>
	<p>
		 I want to become a developer because I love tech. Technology has always fascinated me, from the latest gadgets to the most complex software systems. I enjoy the challenge of solving problems and the satisfaction that comes from building something from scratch. I'm particularly interested in web development and enjoy creating websites that are user-friendly and visually appealing.
